## Attribution

The word search generation algorithm is based on [wordfind](https://github.com/bunkat/wordfind) by bunkat, used under the MIT License. The original wordfind package takes a different approach, focusing on puzzle generation logic. This project builds upon that foundation to create a complete, classroom-ready word search generator with print formatting and teacher/student copy generation.
